            Overweight is becoming an increasing problem in the Netherlands,
            also among children. Simply telling someone to eat less does not
            work. 
            <br></br> <br></br> There are many different reasons why someone is overweight.
            And losing weight often proves to be very difficult in practice. It
            often takes several attempts to maintain a healthy weight in the
            long term. And because overweight is becoming an increasing problem,
            there are more and more people who also try to profit from this
            problem. In all sorts of ways, quick methods and remedies are
            offered that are supposed to help people lose their excess weight
            // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities
            quickly and easily. In practice, unfortunately, it doesn't work that
            way.
            <br></br> <br></br>  If it were that simple to lose weight, then the problem of
            excess weight would be a smaller and smaller problem by now. One of
            the few methods that will help with obesity is learning a healthy
            eating pattern, changing your behavior regarding food and getting
            enough exercise every day; this under the guidance of a well-trained
            nutritionist.

          <div className="lino"></div>

          <p className="img_parar">
            Nutrition forms a basis for the body and mind. The intake of the
            right nutrition is essential. If your body does not receive the
            right nutrition, it will be at the expense of your health. This can
            make you feel tired, listless, irritated, tense or stressed more
            quickly.<br></br> <br></br> By taking the right nutrition, you will feel fit and vital
            again. Not everyone is the same, which is why advice per individual
            is very important. â€‹ An initial nutritional consultation consists of
            a session of approximately 45 minutes, the follow-up takes
            approximately 30 minutes. Before the conversation, you must keep a
            nutritional schedule, which you must bring with you to the first
            consultation. Depending on your goal, a suitable schedule will be
            created.
